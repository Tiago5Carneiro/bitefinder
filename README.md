## Problem

You’re out with friends and no one can agree on where to eat. Suggestions get tossed around, but you end up going nowhere.

## Solution

- Sign Up & Set Preferences

  - Each friend creates a profile and indicates favorite cuisines and dietary restrictions.

  - Create a Group

      BiteFinder’s AI (leveraging Gemini, Mistral and the OpenAI API) combines everyone’s tastes, your dining history and local options from Google Places to produce a shortlist of the best nearby restaurants.

  - Match & Go

      - Once the group agrees on a pick, you have your plan - and a tasty new spot to try!
